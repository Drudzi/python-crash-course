STYLING AND DEPLOYING AN APP:

    Styling Learning Log:

        So far, we've kind of ignored the looks of our web project.
        We've focused mainly on functionality and making it work fully, which is a good way
        of approaching these kind of projects.
        An app is only useful if it works...
        Looks are important for users, which is why it's a critical part of development.
        To style our project, we'll use and integrate the django-bootstrap4 app.

        The django-bootstrap4 App:

            We use pip install django-bootstrap4 to install Bootstrap to our environment.
            But to include Bootstrap, we need to include it in the INSTALLED_APPS list inside settings.py.
        
        Using Bootstrap to Style Learning Log:

            Bootstrap has a large collection of styling tools and templates.
            Templates apply to the overall style which makes them easier to use than
            individual tools.
            At getbootstrap.com, you can find all tools and templates.
            We'll use the Navbar Static template.
        
        Modifying base.html:

            To use the bootstrap4 template, we need to modify the base template.

            Defining the HTML Headers:

                We delete all content inside base.html.
                The first thing we'll add and configure, is the HTML headers.

                ...
                {% load bootstrap4 %}

                <!doctype html>
                <html lang="en">
                <head>
                  <meta charset="utf-8">
                  <meta name="viewport" content="width=devicewidth, initial-scale=1,
                    shrink-to-fit=no">
                  <title>Learning Log</title>

                  {% bootstrap_css %}
                  {% bootstrap_javascript jquery='full' %}

                </head>
                ...

                On the first line, we load the collection of templates tags from bootstrap4.
                The doctype defines what kind of file it should be considered as.
                We also define the HTML language to english.

                An HTML file contains two parts, the head and the body.
                We begin defining the head on the fifth line and indent its content.
                The head doesn't display any content, it just tells the browser what it needs
                to know in order to actually display the page correctly.

                The title tag, tells the browser what to name the page in the title bar.

                The last two tags in the head are from bootstrap customs.
                Bootstrap_CSS tells django to include all style files.
                The last one enables all interactive behavior you might want to use on a page,
                such as collapsible navigation bars.

            Defining the Navigation Bar:

                The code defining the navigation bar will be pretty long, so we'll work in sections.

                ...
                <body>

                  <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-light mb-4 border">

                    <a class="navbar-brand" href="{% url 'learning_logs:index'%}">
                        Learning Log</a>
    
                    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse"
                        data-target="#navbarCollapse" aria-controls="navbarCollapse"
                        aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
                      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button>
                ...

                We start off by opening the body.
                Then we open the navigation element (nav) which controls the navigation sextion on the page.

                Everything inside this element is styled according to the Bootstrap style rules
                defined by the selectors navbar, navbar-expand-md, adn the rest you see in "class"
                at the nav-tag opener.

                A selector determines which page elements apply to a certain style rule.
                Selectors are defined in the class.
                The navbar-ligth and bg-light selectors styles the navbar with a light background.
                The mb-4 selector (mb stands for margin bottom) makes a little space 
                appear between the navbar and the rest of the page.
                The border selector provides a thin little border around the light background
                to set it off a little from the rest of the page.

                After opening the nav section, we define an anchor tag using the navbar-brand class.
                Navbar-brand selector styles this link so it stands out a little from the rest.
                A way of branding the site.
                This project-name link will be on the left side and appear on every page.

                Next, we define a button tag.
                This button will only appear if the browser window is too narrow to display
                the whole navbar horizontally.
                When a user clicks this button, a drop down list of the navbar elements will appear.
                The collapse reference causes the navbar to collapse when the user shrinks the browser window
                or when the site is displayed on mobile devices with small screens.

                ...
                <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarCollapse">
                  <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
                    <li class="nav-item">
                      <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'learning_logs:topics'%}">
                          Topics</a></li>
                  </ul>
                ...

                We add the code above just below the span-tag.
                By opening the div-tag, we start a new section of the navbar.
                Div stands for division.
                You build web pages by dividing it into divisons (sections)
                and design behaviour and styling for each section.

                The styling or behaviour rules you assign in the div-opening affect all the content in the div section.
                This code is the beginning of the collapsed navbar that will appear on smaller screens or windows.

                At the UL-tag, we define a new set of links.
                Bootstrap defines the navigation elements as items in an unordered list with style
                rules that make it look nothing like a list.
                Any link or element you need or want on the navbar can be included in one of these UL lists.

                Then we create a list item, which is a link to our topics page.

                ...
                    <ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto">
                      {% if user.is_authenticated %}
                        <li class="nav-item">
                          <span class="navbar-text">Hello, {{user.username}}.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li class="nav-item">
                          <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'users:logout' %}">Log out</a>
                        </li>
                      {% else %}
                        <li class="nav-item">
                          <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'users:register' %}">Register</a>
                        </li>
                        <li class="nav-item">
                          <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'users:login' %}">Log in</a>
                        </li>
                      {% endif %}
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                </nav>
                ...
                Here, we do once again begin a new set of links by opening the UL tag.
                You are allowed to have as many groups of links on a page as you want.
                This gruop will be the login, logout and registration links, which will
                be located on the right side of the navbar due to ml-auto selector in the UL opening.
                ml-auto stands for margin left automatic, which means it examines the other elements in navbar
                and pushes these to the right side with the right amount. It creates a margin to the left.

                Then, we start an if block, the same we used before to examine whether a user
                is logged in or not.
                If the user is logged in, we start by displaying a welcoming message.
                For this, we use the span tag.
                The span element is used to create and style pieces of text or other elements on a page
                that are part of a longer line. In this case we don't want this text to be a link
                like logout, login and register will be.
                
                Then we create our other navbar elements, which are all going to be links using
                anchor tags.

                We also close this div, which contains the elements that will be in the collapsed navbar.
                The navbar is done for now and we also close the nav tag.

            Defining the Main Part of the Page:

                The rest of base.html will contain the main page.

                ...
                  <main role="main" class="container">
                    <div class="pb-2 mb-2 border-bottom">
                      {% block page_header %}{% endblock page_header %}
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      {% block content %}{% endblock content %}
                    </div>
                  </main>

                </body>

                </html>
                ...

                We begin with opening the main tag, which is the main and most significant part
                of the body.
                We use the container selector, which is a simple and effective way of grouping elements.
                In this container, we use two div tags.
                The first one, the page_header will mostly be used for titles and headlines.
                And compared to the other div, we use some selectors to make this div stand out.
                
                The pb-2 selector stands for padding bottom, and padding refers to space between
                an elements content and it's border. This selector provides a moderate amount
                of padding at the bottom of the element.

                The mb-2 selector stands for margin bottom, and a margin refers to the space between
                an elements border and other elements on the page.

                We also the border-bottom selector, which provides a thin border at the bottom
                of the page_header block.

                The next div tag includes the content block.
                For this part, we don't use any selectors because the styling may differ from
                page to page.

                Start the server and see the new page with the professional navbar.

            Styling the Home Page Using a Jumbotron:

                To update and style the home page, we'll use something called a jumbotron.
                A jumbotron is a large box that stands out from the rest of the page,
                it can contain whatever you want.
                Most likely, it's used on a home page to hold a brief description of the overall project.

                Let's go into index.html:

                ...
                {% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

                {% block page_header %}
                  <div class="jumbotron">
                    <h1 class="display-3">Track your learning.</h1>

                    <p class="lead">
                        Make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the topics
                        you're learning about. Whenever you learn something new about a topic
                        make an entry summarizing what you've learned.
                    </p>

                    <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="{% url 'users:register' %}"
                        role="button">Register &raquo;</a>
                  </div>
                {% endblock page_header %}
                ...

                We begin by opening the page_header block and start the division (section) using the jumbotron selector.
                A jumbotron is not really a thing of its own, it's just a div element with a certain set of
                styling directives from Bootstrap applied to it.

                The jumbotron consists of three elements.
                The first one is the h1, which is a first level header (rubrik), which displays a short message.
                For the h1, we use the display-3 selector which gives it a thinner and taller look.

                The second element is just a simple paragraph with some more detailed information about the project.

                The third element is a welcoming register button.
                As you can see, we can create a button of an anchor tag link using selectors. 
                btn (button) is making the element a button.
                btn-lg makes the button a bit larger.
                btn-primary give the button a blue color which makes it pop out more.

                In between the anchor tags, we define what text the button should display.
                After register we write &raquo; which is called an HTML entity that looks like >>.

            Styling the Login Page:

                Let's modify login.html.
                Here's the new code:

                ...
                {% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}
                {% load bootstrap4 %}

                {% block page_header %}
                  <h2>Log in to your account.</h2>
                {% endblock page_header %}

                {% block content %}  
                  <form method="post" action="{% url 'users:login' %}" class="form">
                    {% csrf_token %}
                    {% bootstrap_form form %}
                    {% buttons %}
                      <button name="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Log in</button>
                    {% endbuttons %}
    
                    <input type="hidden" name="next"
                    value="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}" />
                  </form>

                  {% endblock content %}
                  ...

                  We begin with loading the bootstrap template tags onto our file.

                  In the page_header, we display a lvl 2 header showing a informative message.

                  Then we start the content block.
                  Notice that we removed the {% if form.errors %}-block, this is because bootstrap handles form errors automatically.

                  When we open the form tag, we insert the form class from bootstrap so bootstrap knows it's a form and uses its styling.
                  We replace {{ form.as_p }} with {% bootstrap_form form %} to apply the form styling from bootstrap to
                  the form's individual elements.
                  
                  After that, we open the bootstrap template tag {% buttons %} which adds bootstrap styling to buttons.

              Styling the Topics Page:

                  The topics page doesn't need a lot of work.
                  We move the topics header into the page_header block and remove it from the content block.

                  We add an h3 tag before the links to the topics and to the other elements.
                
              Styling the Entries on the Topic Page:

                  ...
