This is the specification for our web-application-project.
A full spec details the project goals, describes the project's functionality and discusses its appearance and interface.
Like any good project or business plan a spec should keep you focused and help keep your project on track.

We won't write a fully detailed spec for this project.

SPEC:
We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they're interested in
and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic.
The Learning Log will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in.
Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries and read and edit existing entries.
