SETTING UP A PROJECT:
    
    Creating the virtual environment:

        A virtual environment (venv) is a place on your system where you can install packages
        and isolate them from all other Python packages.
        Separating one project's libraries from other projects is beneficial and
        will be necessary when we deploy LL to a server.

        We set up a new directory (learning_log) for our project and use the venv module to setup a virtual env:
        In command promt, in the right directory, we enter the following to create a venv called ll_venv:
        
        python -m venv ll_venv
