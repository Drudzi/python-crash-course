SETTING UP A PROJECT:
    
    Creating the virtual environment:

        A virtual environment (venv) is a place on your system where you can install packages
        and isolate them from all other Python packages.
        Separating one project's libraries from other projects is beneficial and
        will be necessary when we deploy LL to a server.

        We set up a new directory (learning_log) for our project and use the venv module to setup a virtual env:
        In command promt, in the right directory, we enter the following to create a venv called ll_venv:
            python -m venv ll_venv

        We activate the env:
            ll_env\Scripts\activate

        Deactivate using 'deactivate' in cmd.

    Installing Django:

        pip install django
        Keep in mind that Django will be available only when the ll_env is active.
        Name of venv in parentheses in terminal shows that your venv is active.
    
    Creating a Project in Django:

        Tell Django to setup a new project in console:
            django-admin startproject learning_log .
        
        Don't forget the dot at the end,
        it creates our project in a beneficial structure.

        Django has created a new folder (directory) called learning_log containing some py-files and manage.py.
    
    Creating the Database:

        Django stores most information in a database, we create one in console using the manage.py:
            python manage.py migrate

        Modifying a database is called migrating.
        When entering migrate command first time, it creates an SQLite database for us.

    Viewing the Project:

        Using...
            python manage.py runserver
        Django starts a development server, so you can view your project on your system to see how it works.

        You can see if there were any issues and Django will give you the localhost URL as well.

STARTING AN APP:

    Django projects are individual apps that are working together to create a whole.
    For now, we'll use one app to do most of the work.
    When the server is running and we are in the venv, we create a new app in console:
        python manage.py startapp learning_logs
    
    Command startapp 'appname' tells Django to create the infrastructure needed to create an app.
    It creates it in a new folder called learning_logs, in this case.

    Defining Models:
