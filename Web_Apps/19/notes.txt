ALLOWING USERS TO ENTER DATA:

    Before building an authentication system for users to create accounts,
    we'll add some pages allowing users to enter their own data.
    They should have the ability to create topics, new entries and also edit entries.

    Currently, only the superuser can do these things using the admin site
    and we don't want users to interact with the admin site, so we'll use
    Django's form-building tools to build pages allowing users to enter data.

    Adding New Topics:

        Let's begin with allowing users to create new topics.
        Building a form-based page isn't much different to building the ones we already have,
        the major difference is the addition of a new module called forms.py containing the forms.

        The Topic ModelForm:

            Any web page that let's users enter and submit information is called a form.
            Whenever users enter information, we need to validate that information
            to ensure it's the right kind of data and that it's not malicious (code interrupting our server).
            
            When we recieve information from a user, we need to process it and save the valid data
            to the right place in our database. Django is good with this and automates much of this for us.

            Using a ModelForm is the simplest way to build a form in Django.
            A ModelForm using the data from our models in models.py to automatically create forms.

            We'll write our first form in forms.py, which we create in the app directory.
        
        The new_topic URL:

            Now we want to create a page where users can actually add new topics.
            URLs should preferably be short and descriptive, so we'll use 'new_topic'.
            We add this URL-pattern to learning_logs/urls.py and send the requests to
            new_topic() in views.py, which we'll create next.
        
        The new_topic() View Function:

            The view function for the new_topic page needs to handle two major situations:
                
                Initial requests for the new_topic page (in which case it should show a blank form)
                and the processing of any data submitted in the form.
                It should also redirect the user back to the topics page, when data from a
                submitted form is processed.
            
            We create new_topic() in views.py.
        
        GET and POST Requests:

            There are different kinds of requests, the two main types are GET and POST when building web apps.
            GET requests are used for pages that only read data from the server.
            POST request are usually used when a user needs to submit information through a form.

            There are a few more types of requests but we won't use them for this project.

            When the user initially requests the page, the browser will send a GET request.
            But, once the user has filled out and submitted the form,
            the browser will send a POST request.

            By knowing what kind of request it is, we know whether the user requests
            a blank form (GET) or asking us to process a completed form (POST).

            See views.py and the new_topic function.
        
        The new_topic Template:

            We'll create the new_topic.html template to display the form.

            ...
            {% extends 'learning_logs/new_topic.html' %}

            {% block content %}
              <p>Add a new topic:</p>

              <form action="{% url 'learning_logs:new_topic' %}" method='post'>
                {% csrf_token %}
                {{ form.as_p }}
                <button name="submit">Add topic</button>
              </form>

            {% endblock content %}
            ...

            On the sixth row, we define an HTML form.
            The first argument 'action', tells the browser where to send the information from the form.
            We'll send it to the new_topic() view function.
            The second argument 'method', tells the browser what request to submit.
            We tell it to submit a POST-request.

            On row 7, we write a template tag which prevents attackers from using the form
            to gain unauthorized access to the server.
            This kind of attack is called a cross-site request forgery (csrf).

            On row 8, we display the form.
            See how simple Django does a task like this.
            The template variable {{ form.as_p }} tells Django to create the fields and display the form.
            as_p is a modifier which tells Django to render all the form elements in
            a paragraph format, as a simple way to display the form neatly.
            
            At row 9, we create a button because Django doesn't do it by default.
            The name argument tells Django what kind of a button it is, 
            and we tell Django it will submit the form.
        
        Linking to the new_topic Page:

            Next step is to add a link to the new_topic page on the topics page.
            We modify topics.html and add a link after the list of existing topics.

            <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:new_topic' %}">Add a new topic</a>

    Adding New Entries:

        Let's also allow users to create and edit entries.

        The Entry ModelForm:

            Like we did with topics, we'll also need to create a form associated with the Entry model.
            We create EntryForm in forms.py.
        
        The new_entry URL:

            We define its URL pattern in urls.py.

            path('new_entry/<int:topic_id>/', views.new_entry, name='new_entry')

            We include the topic_id argument because this page needs to be associated with a specific topic.

        The new_entry() View Function:

            ...
