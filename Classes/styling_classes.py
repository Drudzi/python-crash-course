# Class names should always be written like this:

#   CamelCase
#   Car
#   ElectricCar
#   BananaGuy

#Every word in class name should be capitalized, no underscores in between.

#Method names and instance names should be written in lowercase with underscores in between words:

#   class_method
#   show_gas_level


# Every class should also include a docstring at the top, describing it briefly:
"""This is a docstring, describing this class."""

# Every module should also include a docstring at the top, describing it briefly:
"""This is a docstring, describing the whole module."""


# Use blank lines to organize code, but not too excessively.

# Within a class, use one blank line to separate methods.
# Within a module, use two blank lines to separate classes.


#If you need a module from Python's standard library and also one of your own...
# put the import line for the module from the standard library first and separate them with a blank line.

#If using multiple import statements, this helps you recognize where modules come from.
