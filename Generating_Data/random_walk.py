#   RANDOM WALKS:
# A random walk is a path that is determined by a series of completely random decisions.
#  Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology, chemistry and economics.
#
#   ex) A pollen grain floating on a drop of water moves across the surface of the water because...
#        it's constantly pushed around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random...
#         so the path a pollen grain traces on the surface is a random walk.
#
# Random walks can model many real-world situations.

# choice chooses a random item in a list of items.

# Let's create a class that will make random decisions about which direction the walk should take:
