#We'll make a histogram, showing how often certain results occur.

data = [Bar(x=x_values, y=frequencies)]
#The Bar class represents a data set that will form a bar chart.
# Bar needs a set of x-values and y-values.
#  A Bar object should be wrapped in square brackets because a data set can have multiple elements.

# should be stored in a dictionary.

offline.plot({'data': data, 'layout': my_layout}, filename='d6_d6.html')
#offline.plot is used to generate the plot.
# It needs a dictionary containing the data and layout objects.
#  You can also specify a filename for the file where the graph will be saved.

#The file should open in a web browser.
